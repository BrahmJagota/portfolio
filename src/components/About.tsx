        My journey into tech started with gaming during the COVID-19 lockdown, where I spent countless hours playing online with friends. That curiosity led me into hacking, exploring cryptography and networking, but I soon realized my real passion lay elsewhere. In 2022, I started my BCA degree and discovered web developmentâ€”where creativity meets logic. I began with C and C++, building a strong foundation, and now, I craft full-stack applications with TypeScript. What started as curiosity has turned into an exciting path of continuous learning, innovation, and turning ideas into reality.
